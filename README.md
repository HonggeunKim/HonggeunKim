## Hi, I am Honggeun Kim
I'm a graduate student at MIT at the [Kavli Institute for Astrophysics](https://space.mit.edu/). I developed a fast version of the simulator for radio signal measurements by streamlining redundant calculations and parallelizing computationally extensive tasks [here](https://github.com/vispb/vispb). My work also includes extracting tomographic information from 3D (radio) images using Unet, consisting of encoding and deconding brenches. I am particularly interested in a variety of machine learning techniques/applications including computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, generative models, etc.
